## monty - simple monitoring toolset.

Simple tools to allow monitoring aspects to be triggered by annotations.
Relies on AspectJ (language, you are free to pick your own impl,
ie byteweave or spring proxy)

Currently uses JaMon 2.71 for stopwatch and timers. If you want to "see" the results,
add the jamon .war to your project found in the zip at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jamonapi/v2_71


Compiled up to Java 1.5 language level so will work for 1.5 upwards.
